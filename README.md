# Udacity Python Bikeshare Project

## Project Overview
This project utilises **Python 3** to explore US Bikeshare data across three different cities; _Chicago_, _New York City_, and _Washington_. The program was designed to produce descriptive statistics based on filtering by the user.

## Datasets
The datasets utilised in this project contain randomly selected data from the first 6 months of 2017 in each of the three cities. The information provided includes Start and End Times, Trip Durations, Start and End Stations, and User Type. In addition, Gender and Birth Year data is available for Chicago and New York City.
With the option to filter by city, month, and day of the week, users can return statistics such as most frequent times of travel, most popular stations, average trip durations, user type counts, and birth year information. Raw data is also available to view.

## Software
The software requirements for this project were Python 3, with the addition of the Python libraries NumPy and Pandas. These were installed using Anaconda.
